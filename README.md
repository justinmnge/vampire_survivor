# README

Welcome to **Vampire Survivor!** In this intense survival action game, you find yourself alone in a gothic nightmare, armed with nothing but a trusty pistol and your wits. As darkness descends, an relentless horde of supernatural creatures emerges from the shadows – blood-thirsty bats swoop from above, skeletal warriors march endlessly forward, and mysterious gelatinous blobs ooze ever closer.
Face an escalating wave of enemies as you desperately try to survive:

 - Dodge lethal swarms of vampire bats
 - Outmaneuver shambling skeleton warriors
 - Avoid the corrosive touch of mysterious blob creatures

With each passing minute, the swarm grows larger, faster, and more deadly. How long can you last before the creatures of the night consume you? Every run is a dance with death, where survival is measured in minutes and seconds.

Test your reflexes, improve your strategy, and push your limits in this haunting battle against the inevitable. In Vampire Survivor, it's not about if you'll fall – it's about how long you can stand against the darkness.
